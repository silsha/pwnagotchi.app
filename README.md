## Disclaimer
This is my first project in Swift and my main goal was to play around with SwiftUI and Catalyst. I was impressed with how quickly I was able to get a working product up and running, but I realize that I am only scratching the surface of the subject.
Pull requests are more than welcome, but please refrain from completely rewriting the app as this would undermine my learning plans.
